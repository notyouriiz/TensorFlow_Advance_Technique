# TensorFlow_Advance_Technique
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML, and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications. TensorFlow is commonly used for machine learning applications such as voice recognition and detection, Google Translate, image recognition, and natural language processing.

## Overview
Expand your knowledge of the Functional API and build exotic non-sequential model types. Learn how to optimize training in different environments with multiple processors and chip types and get introduced to advanced computer vision scenarios such as object detection, image segmentation, and interpreting convolutions. Explore generative deep learning including the ways AIs can create new content from Style Transfer to Auto Encoding, VAEs, and GANs

## Application
In this Specialization, you will gain practical knowledge of and hands-on training in advanced TensorFlow techniques such as style transfer, object detection, and generative machine learning.
